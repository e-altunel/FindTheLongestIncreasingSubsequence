# FindTheLongestIncreasingSubsequence
It basically find the longest sequence in a given sequence.
For example you want to find the longest increasing subsequence of [3,1,8,2,5]:

  * It gives every item an parentIndex and lenght variable.
  * Lenght variable is for sequence lenght.
  * For example: 3 -> 8 is a valid sequence so the program give 0 length to 3 and 1 lenght to 8.
  * Hepsine verince sonuç çıkıyor işte. Açıklamaya üşendim.
